# HabCord
A discord bot which sends messages to what your discord bot receives.

# Requirements
- You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- You may need [Python from Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7) (In my case python WILL NOT work without them both being installed)

# Installation
- 1. Run `python setup.py`. This will install the requirements for the script.
- 2. You will need a [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/applications) token.
- 3. Edit the [main.py](https://github.com/iUseYahoo/HabCord/blob/main/main.py) when downloaded and change the fields at the top.

# Running the script
- 1. Run `python main.py`. This will start the bot.
- Any issues make a request of it [Here](https://github.com/iUseYahoo/HabCord/issues/new).

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
- DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN, IT ALLOWS TOKEN HOLDERS TO MAKE YOUR BOT MALICIOUS AND DO VERY BAD THINGS TO SERVERS IF IT HAS ADMINISTRATION.
